					<br> 
					<h3>What is Tetelestai?</h3> 
					<p>Tet&#233;lestai (a Greek word meaning "It is Finished") is a contemporary musical drama about 
					the last week in Jesus' life written by Russ and Joel Nagy.  The show, now in its 35th season, 
					vividly portrays Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem, His trial, execution and His resurrection.  
					It will be staffed by UALC adults and performed by a cast of high school students.</p> 
					<h3>Is this like a school musical?</h3> 
					<p>Not really.  With a school musical you audition, return for call-backs, receive your part, and 
					start memorizing.  Perhaps at the end you might perform 2 shows.  With Tetelestai you audition once 
					and then rehearsals begin. We spend the first weeks training the entire cast to act in the style of 
					professional theatre. A second audition for singing roles happens after a few weeks of rehearsals. 
					Eventually, you'll use stage makeup, be provided with costumes (no shopping!), and you'll be mentored 
					in the technical responsibilities of the show. No prior experience is necessary.</p> 
					<h3>When are auditions and how do I sign up?</h3> 
					<p>Auditions times are available on December 12th & 19th - 2-5pm at the 2300 Lytham Rd campus of 
					Upper Arlington Lutheran Church. High school students may schedule an audition by calling DeEtte 
					DeWeese at 844-5430 (evenings) or emailing - <a href="mailto: tttstagemngr@gmail.com">tttstagemngr@gmail.com</a>.</p> 
					<h3>What can I expect at my audition?</h3> 
					<p>You'll fill out a short information sheet so we can get your, name address, etc. Then the audition 
					consists of three parts: 1) Singing 2) Acting  3) Q & A - to address questions about cost, schedule, etc.  
					Expect the whole process to take around 20 minutes. No advance preparation is necessary.</p> 
					<h3>What do I need to bring with me to my audition?</h3> 
					<p>1 - A willing attitude! We aren't expecting professionals, so relax.<br> 
					2 - Your calendar so you can note any schedule conflicts you may have</p> 
					<h3>How many shows will we perform?</h3> 
					<p>Performances are in March.  We'll do a few weekend shows out of town, tour Ft. Wayne and 
					Indianapolis over spring break, and then give 4 home shows the week before Easter.  The total will 
					be around 10 shows.</p> 
					<h3>Who is staffing the show?</h3> 
					<p>Volunteer members of UALC including: DeWeese, Bruns, Nagy, Gilliam, Borden, Long, and many more!</p> 
					<h3>Who's Jesus?  Which one's Jesus?</h3> 
					<p>Joe Long will portray role of Christ for the 2010 season.</p>
